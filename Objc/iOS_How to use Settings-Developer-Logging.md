 Actually this option Developer-\>Logging under Settings app on
iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch has nothing to do with your application source
code log statements but as the header "power" suggests, you can turn
this Logging option ON and OFF to know the power consumption of your iOS
application on your device when the device is not connected to your
development box. \
