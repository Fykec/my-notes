k CFURL Error Cancelled {.heading-level2}
-----------------------

A other way to trigger such errors is to click very quickly on 2 links.
The first request is canceled (--\> Trigger the -999 error).\
 If you want to avoid such error, you can add some overhead code in
order to assure that when something is loading nothing else can be
loaded. But as pumba said it is not a big deal.\
