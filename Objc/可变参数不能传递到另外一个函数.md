 \
 Is there a way that I can pass the contents of the elipsis from my
function's entry to another function? \
 \
 You can't, you can only pass the arguments as a va\_list. See the
comp.lang.c FAQ.\
 \
 In general, if you're writing variadic functions (that is, functions
which take a variable number of arguments) in C, you should write two
versions of each function: one which takes an ellipsis (...), and one
which takes a va\_list. The version taking an ellipsis should call
va\_start, call the version taking a va\_list, call va\_end, and return.
There's no need for code duplication between the two versions of the
function, since one calls the other.
