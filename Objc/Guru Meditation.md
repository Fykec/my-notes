 Guru Meditation is an error notice displayed by early versions of the
Commodore Amiga computer when they crashed. It is analogous to the "Blue
Screen Of Death" in Microsoft Windows operating systems. It has later
been used as an error message elsewhere, such as Varnish (software), a
reverse proxy and HTTP accelerator[1].\

 When a Guru Meditation is displayed, the options are to reboot by
pressing the left mouse button, or to invoke ROMWack by pressing the
right mouse button. (ROMWack is a minimalist debugger built into the
operating system which is accessible by connecting a 9600 bit/s terminal
to the serial port.)[citation needed]
